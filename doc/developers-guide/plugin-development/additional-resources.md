## Writing a plugin in Python

Check out a step-by-step recipe for building a simple `helloworld.py` example plugin based on [pyln-client](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/contrib/pyln-client).

🦉 **[Write a hello-world plugin in Python](https://docs.corelightning.org/v1.0/recipes/write-a-hello-world-plugin-in-python)** _(upstream CLN tutorial — plugin API is identical in Palladium Lightning)_

You can also follow along the video below where Rusty Russell walks you through getting started with the upstream Core Lightning project and building a plugin in Python (the plugin API is identical in Palladium Lightning).

Finally, `lightningd`'s own internal [tests](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/tests/plugins) can be a useful (and most reliable) resource.

## Writing a plugin in Rust

[`cln-plugin`](https://docs.rs/cln-plugin/) is a library that facilitates the creation of plugins in Rust, with async/await support, for low-footprint plugins.

## Community built plugins

Check out this [repository](https://github.com/lightningd/plugins#plugin-builder-resources) that has a collection of actively maintained plugins as well as plugin libraries (in your favourite language) built by the community.
